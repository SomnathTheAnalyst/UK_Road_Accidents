# UK_Road_Accidents

The UK government collects and publishes (usually on an annual basis) detailed information about traffic accidents across the country. This information includes, but is not limited to, geographical locations, weather conditions, type of vehicles, number of casualties and vehicle manoeuvres, making this a very interesting and comprehensive dataset for analysis and research.

The creation of this dataset was inspired by the one previously published by Dave Fisher-Hickey. However, this current dataset features the following significant improvements over its predecessor:

It covers a wider date range of events.
Most of the coded data variables have been transformed to textual strings using relevant lookup tables, enabling more efficient and "human-readable" analysis.
It features detailed information about the vehicles involved in the accidents.
